| [Dynamic Knowledge Tracing for Personalized Learning Pathways Using Deep Learning](https://github.com/safrin96/DKT/tree/main) | This project explores the use of Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), a machine learning technique that leverages sequential data modeling, to predict a learner's mastery of various skills over time. By analyzing sequences of student interactions with educational content, the DKT model estimates the probability that a learner has mastered specific topics and dynamically adjusts the learning path based on real-time performance. | Python, Tensorflow, Looker Studio|
