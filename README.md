## Data Science

| Project Link  | Project Description | Tools
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [Dynamic Knowledge Tracing for Personalized Learning Pathways Using Deep Learning](https://github.com/safrin96/DKT/tree/main) | This project explores the use of Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), a machine learning technique that leverages sequential data modeling, to predict a learner's mastery of various skills over time. By analyzing sequences of student interactions with educational content, the DKT model estimates the probability that a learner has mastered specific topics and dynamically adjusts the learning path based on real-time performance. | Python, Matplotlib, Keras, Tensorflow |
| [CryptoTimeSeries](https://github.com/safrin96/CryptoTimeSeries) | This project predicts Bitcoin prices using time-series analysis techniques, including ARIMA, SARIMA, and Prophet models. It features exploratory data analysis, trend and seasonality detection, and volatility analysis. Real-world data is fetched from the CoinGecko API, and an ensemble approach is used to enhance forecast accuracy. Key findings, visualizations, and performance metrics are organized for a comprehensive financial forecasting example. | Python, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, Scipy, Pandas, Sklearn, ARIMA, Prophet |

| [Big Store Company Budget Plan](https://github.com/safrin96/BSC-Budget-Plan/blob/main/README.md) | Analyzed the revenue of 2017-2019 across the company based on region, category and subcategory. The purpose of the analysis is to create a 3-year budget plan for the company to focus on key/critical products and adopt appropriate marketing strategy to gain the highest revenue return from the targeted regions.Â In the process, scrutinized the possibility of additional revenue growth of 5%, 10% and 15%. Finally, produced the 5% additional rational maximum growth plan for the year 1 budget and focused on mitigating and have leeway of change based on unexpected market landscape changes | Power BI, Excel | [Dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMDhhNWU3YTItYjBmYi00NTIyLTkwN2YtMjU3MTNlZTRhMDIxIiwidCI6IjU2MzMzN2NhLWE1MTctNDIxYS1hYWUwLTFhYTViNDE0ZmQ3ZiIsImMiOjZ9) |
